        <p>Hiroshima, a shadow burned in time
        Nagasaki, naked baby melts alive
        Burnt flesh and rubble from sea to dead shore
        Such a hideous theater of war
        But that was the end, why?<br>
        <i>There are so many more that must die
        Is that not part of the plan?</i>
        I must use the nukes
        I can't kill you all with my hands
        Hydrogen bomb, new signs of doom
        Thermo-nuclear, neutron bomb too
        You say these devices must never be used
        I say you're mistaken, let's get to the fuse</p>
        <hr>
        Bring!<br>
        <b>Bring back the bomb</b>
        This is state policy, by other means
        Your life ends in terror, this is now decreed
        This is the blasting of bloody steel beams
        The bomb blows air backwards, there's no time to scream
        When they tested the A-bomb, they had a real fear
        The blast will destroy your sweet atmosphere
        But far more important as power increases
        Was wasting the planet in well-ordered pieces
        Bring!
        <span style="color:red">Bring back the bomb
        Bring! Bring! Bring!
        Bring back the bomb
        Bring back the bomb</span>, it's been far too long
        Summon the brazen war chariot
        Bring back the bomb, what makes it so wrong?
        Release the beast, you can't bury it
        Ha!
        Ha!
        Ha!
        Ha!
        Ha!
        Ha!
        Hrah!
        Haaa
        Why should the fire be shared with so few?
        Let bombs explode, 'cause that's what they do
        Nuke Mecca, New York, the Vatican too
        Give me a bomb, I'll drop it on you
        Why stop at only two?
        You showed the world just what they can do
        What a waste not to destroy
        Come play at war, man, and bring your best toy
        Who gives a fuck about a nuclear war?
        Let bombs explode, 'cause that's what they're for
        Last minute warning, the sirens they sing
        Chaos, the reason, death, what we bring
        Humans now look to the sky
        You worship missiles, yet they know no side
        I guess it was all a lie
        So grab ass with both hands, it's your turn to die
        Die! It's your turn to die
        Die! It's your turn to die
        Lies! They killed you with lies
        Die, human, die!
        And while we're at it, let's go nuke Tibet
        Let's vaporize the oceans with glee
        Saving the whales, an agenda for some
        Nuking them sits well with me
        Bring!
        Bring back the bomb
        They know not what they do!
        Bring!
        Bring back the bomb
        Bring back the bomb, it's been far too long
        Summon the brazen war chariot
        Bring back the bomb, what makes it so wrong?
        Crucify Judas Iscariot
        Bring!
        Bring back the bomb
        They know not what they do
        Bring!
        Bring back the bomb
        What makes it so wrong?
